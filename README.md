Nitrous bypasses heavy, bloated OEM telemetry services by communicating directly with your Acer Nitro’s Embedded Controller (EC) via WMI. It gives you a ultra-fast, lightweight dashboard for raw, instant hardware control.

### Key Features
* **Dedicated GPU OC/UC Tab:** Fine-tune core and memory offsets to overclock or underclock your GPU.
* **In-Depth GPU Telemetry:** Monitor real-time GPU metrics, clock speeds, usage, and thermal performance alongside your tuning controls.
* **Auto-Apply OC Profiles:** Automatically trigger default GPU overclocks based on active power profiles (mimicking native NitroSense behavior) or automatically apply your custom OC profile on system boot.
* **Granular Fan Control:** Set precise fan speeds from 0% to 100%, or toggle Auto and Max modes via verified 64-bit WMI payloads.
* **Smart Automation:** Automatically applies quiet modes and 60Hz screen refresh on battery, then restores performance and high refresh rate on AC power.
* **Battery Protection:** Hardware-level 80% charge limit to extend battery lifespan.
* **Dynamic Power Profiles:** Toggle instantly between Quiet, Balanced, Performance, and Turbo TDP modes.
* **Silent Boot:** Bypasses Windows UAC using Task Scheduler to start silently with Windows.
* **Built-in Auto-Updater:** Detects and installs updates directly from GitHub.
